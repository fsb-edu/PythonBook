Possible topics for Python course:

* For loops and the different varieties in Python (range, enumerate, neither)
* Explaining functions and how variables are saved in functions (how variables in functions still point to the original variable instantiation).
* Debugging practice. Give a code that does not work and find out why. Learning to read errors.
* Some git introduction
* Data and file organization
* Reading and writing csv/txt files
* Basic algorithms (eg. Lots of for loops is bad)
* Introduce data analysis packages (pandas, matplotlib, scipy, numpy)


I would use a similar structure as this online Harvard course: https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50P+Python/home

* Introduction
* Functions and variables
* Conditionals
* Loops
* Exceptions
* Libraries
* Unit Tests # try, assert and debugging
* File I/O # opening and working with files
* Regular expressions # Not really needed I'd say
* OOP
* Et Cetera # Python gimmicks and conventions


Maybe:

* Classes
* Virtual environments and version handling
