    "***Programming*** is the process of writing code or software (computer programs). The people who write software are called programmers. As stated before, programs are sequences of instructions that can be interpreted by computers (more precisely, hardware components of a computer). From the figure above, we can see how software and hardware are related in the programming context - the programmer writes code (software) and runs it in a computer (hardware) to get some results. "

    "We will interpret {numref}`comp_arch` from left to right. We will start with the ***input devices***. They allow us to interact with the computer and input data. Examples of such devices include: keyboard, USB sticks, mouse, CDs, etc. Then the middle part of the figure shows the most important components of a computer. This is where the magic happens. You can see the ***secondary storage***. This is where data is saved permanently or until you decide to delete it. Examples include Hard Disk Drives (HDD) and Solid State Drives (SSD). Then ***main memory*** (also known as ***Random Access Memory***) is another type of storage, which is volatile, meaning that once a process is completed or electricity is cut off, everything that resides there will be gone. ***Main memory*** communicates with the ***secondary storage*** to get data. These data data will be sent to the ***CPU (Central Processing Unit)***, which applies some instructions to these data to process them. Both data and instructions are loaded into memory. As far as ***main memory*** and ***secondary storage*** are concerned, there is no distincion between what is instructions and what is data: ***CPU*** is able to distinguish those since it applies instructions to the data that it gets from the memory. Also the figure shows the ***ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit)*** that is part of the CPU. This is like the brain of the CPU, responsible for most of the operations taking place there. The last part of the figure shows the ***output devices***, which are devices used to render output. Examples include the monitor, printer, etc."

    "It is intuitive for us to have everything organized in files that we can open and read. However, the letters and numbers that we can distinguish and understand do not make sense to a computer. Computers can only understand sequences of 0s and 1s (binary code). For this reason, there is a whole pipeline of code that translates files and data from human readable form to a sequence of 0s and 1s. Each 0 or 1 is called a ***bit***. Each bucket (cell) of the main memory can hold only a 0 or a 1. This sequence of 0s and 1s is then transferred to the CPU for processing. The CPU is able to parse this sequence of 0s and 1s. In addition, in the secondary storage everything is stored as a sequence of 0s and 1s as well. In {numref}`data_rep` you can see how a file is broken down in lines, each line in words, each word in characters, each character in a bit sequence and each bit sequence in bits which are ultimately processed by the components of the computer."
