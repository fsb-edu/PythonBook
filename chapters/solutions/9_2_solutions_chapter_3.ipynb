    "In this case, none of the function calls will be able to execute correctly because either `a` or `b` will not have been initialized. In the first case, `x=1`, `y=2` and `z=3`. The first statement in the function block is executed and it *shadows* argument `x`. So `x` will have the value 5. Then `y=2` implies that `y>0` is true, so `a` will be 15. `b` will not be initialized since the `else` block  is skipped. When it comes to the return statement, an error will be thrown because we are trying to access `b` without ever initializing it in any part of the code. In the second case, the same logic follows, but instead of `b` now `a` will not be initialized because the condition `y>0` will fail since `y=-2`. So the code will fail trying to access `a` in the return statement. The second and the third cases have the same failure reasoning."

    "This is similar to the previous exercise. However, note that now we are checking for the value of `z` as well. In the first function call, we are passing arguments: `x=1`, `y=2` and `z=3`. The value of `x` does not have any effect since we are changing it to 5 in the first statement in the function block. Then we go and check  if `y>0`, which is true, thus `a` is initialized to 15. Next, we go and check if `z>0`, which is true, thus `b` is initialized to 6. In the end we return the product of `15*6 = 90`. Note how we are able to access variables declared within `if` blocs outside of these blocks but inside the function.\n",
