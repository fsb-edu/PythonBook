    "***Variables*** are nothing more than *placeholders* for values. Each variable has a name (**identifier**), which we as programmers give it. Also, each variable is assigned a value using the = (assignment operator). Variables are saved in the main memory (main memory cells) of a computer for the duration of the execution of a program. What really happens is this: when we give a name to a variable we actually name the memory location that will hold the value for that variable. The name that we give to the variables is not relevant to the computer at all. In the end, when the program is being executed the name will be translated to a memory address. {numref}`var-assign` illustrates the idea."

In addition there are some rules regarding the characters that an **identifier** can have. For example, they can contain letters, digits and underscores (_). However, an identifier must never start with a digit. Also, Python is a *case-sensitive* programming language. This means that two variables `a` and `A` are different.
