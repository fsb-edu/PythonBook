Welcome to this Python course! In today's world, programming has become an integral part of any field of study, including Food Science. Use of Python and other programming languages will enable you to automate complex tasks, including processing and analysis of large datasets, statistical analysis, data visualization, et cetera. Thus, familiarizing yourself with a language like Python is of great importance if you want to not only streamline your own work but also understand other people's code. 

Python is an incredibly versatile programming language - this book aims to introduce all the basic concepts that you need to comfortably use it in your daily work. We hope that going through the theory and exercises presented here will allow you to familiarize yourself with Python. If you already have experience with coding you may also treat this book as a cheatsheet or a reference.

Happy coding!
