    "Tuples, just like lists are sequences of values. However, unlike lists they are **immutable**. This means that they cannot be modified during program execution: you cannot add or remove elements or modify any of the singleton items (like integers, floats, etc). Just like lists, they can have heterogenous or homogenous data. Everything enclosed in parenthesis () is a tuple. Also, tuples are ordered, this means that the items in the tuple have an order defined at the time they are created which cannot change. Some examples of tuples:"
