    "Until now, all the data we have dealt with was created on the fly and resided in the memory for the duration of the execution of the program. If we close the browser window and reopen it again to run the program, the data will be recreated from the beginning in the computer that will run the code. But what if we spend a lot of time to create the data each time we need it? This is not an efficient way. For that reason, we can create the data once, save it in a file and each time we need it, we simply read it from the file. This saves a lot of time. "

    "From Python's perspective, a file is nothing more than a sequence of *elements*. Elements can be of different types. For example, in the case of text files the *elements* that make the sequence are nothing more than characters, whiles in the case of images, videos, etc these elements are simply bytes. As all sequences, even these are 0-index based. At the end of teh file is an end-of-file marker that sends a signal to the method that reads the file, that its end was reached. But this is nothing that concerns us as programmers as this process is entirely handled by the methods themselves."

    "The `with` keyword is used to acquire the resource specified by the `file_name` argument in the `opne()` function. In other words, at this moment our program will get exclusive access to the file specified by the `file_name`.  The `mode='w'`, tells the `open()` function the reason why the program is accessing the file. There are different modes that we can pass as arguments that we list below:\n",
    "- `r` (read) - opens a file for *reading it*.\n",
    "- `w` (write) - opens a file for *writing to it*. If the file does not exist it will be created and if it already exists, its contents will be overwritten.\n",
    "- `a` (append) - opens a file for *writing to it*, but the difference is that it will not overwrite the contents of the file if it already exists. Otherwise it is the same as the `w` mode.\n",
    "- `x` (exclusive creation) - this mode will try to create the file from scratch and if the file exists it will raise an error.\n",
    "- `r+` - opens a file to read and write from/to it and contents will be overridden.\n",
    "- `w+` - opens a file to read and write from/to it but any existing content will be deleted.\n",
    "- `a+` - opens a text file to read and append to it at the end of the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each time we deal with a file, be it for reading or writing purposes the interpreter will assign a file object to it, to handle all the underlying tasks like opening the file and actually reading/writing from/to it. In the above syntax we refer to this object as `object_name`. Then, in the case of writing to a file we use the `write()` method of the `object_name` to write the actual content to the file.\n",
