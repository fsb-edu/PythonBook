    "So far, the statements in the code blocks we have seen have executed sequentially, meaning each statement would be executed after the previous statements have executed. However, this is not always the case. Sometimes based on some condition some statements should be executed and others should be ignored. In other cases, some statements should be executed repeatedly until some condition fails. That's where **conditional statements** and **loops** become helpful. They are fundamental to every piece of software."
