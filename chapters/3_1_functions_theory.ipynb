After the function name, a list of parameters is enclosed in parenthesis. These are variables that will be used in the body of the function. Note that the parameters' list might be empty as well. After that `:` indicate the end of the function definition. Then the declaration of the body of the function begins. If the function needs to return something then at the end a `return` statement should be included. We will see some examples. \n",

When we call the function, we provide values for the arguments that its expects, that are 3 numbers. Then the control flow goes inside the body of the function, assigns to the `min_value` variable the value of `no_1`. Then its starts checking if `no_2` is smaller than the `min_value` and if so, we assign the value of `no_2` to the `min_value`. The last check is done with the `no_3` variable. If its value is less than the value of `min_value`, then we assign its value to the `min_value` variable. At the end in the `return` statement, we return the value of the smallest number. After the function finishes its execution, the `return` statement brings the control back to the print function and prints the whole statement by appending to the string the smallest number."
