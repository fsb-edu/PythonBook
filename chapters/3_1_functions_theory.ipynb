When we call the function, we provide values for the arguments that its expects, that are 3 numbers. Then the control flow goes inside the body of the function, assigns to the `min_value` variable the value of `no_1`. Then its starts checking if `no_2` is smaller than the `min_value` and if so, we assign the value of `no_2` to the `min_value`. The last check is done with the `no_3` variable. If its value is less than the value of `min_value`, then we assign its value to the `min_value` variable. At the end in the `return` statement, we return the value of the smallest number. After the function finishes its execution, the `return` statement brings the control back to the print function and prints the whole statement by appending to the string the smallest number."
