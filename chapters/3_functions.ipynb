    "In {ref}`Chapter 2 <chapter1-label>`, we printed a lot variables and their types. For each of these 'jobs' we had to write the print statement explicitly. Likewise, in {ref}`Chapter 3 <chapter2-label>`, there were many repeating code blocks. The result: we ended up with many copy-pasted statements that look almost the same. If you think of this, given that programs may grow to be really large, copy-pasted code is not a good idea at all. That is when **functions** come to help. They are code blocks that help avoid code repetition."
