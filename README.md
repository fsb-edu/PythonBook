# PythonPandas_JB
JupyterBook on Python/Pandas introduction for Food Scientists.






Every 'title' (a title is words with a # in front of it) in your .ipynb file will be added as a chapter on the welcome page. 

These steps clearly explain how to create a book: https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/create.html I want to change it to make it more accessible. 

In the main folder new files can be added. These files need to be added to the _toc.yml file to show up in the book. 
The name of the file in the left file menue is the fist title in the document. Maybe problem with new notebook not being in the go to next page thingy?
